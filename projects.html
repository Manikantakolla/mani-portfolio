  <b><u>A Survey On Object Detection</u></b>
  <p>
    • Development Object detection algorithms have enabled us to build better facial recognition technology, self-driving cars, and
smarter security systems.
<br>
• Implemented facial recognition data set to identify registered faces,The system efficiently identifies registered faces, seamlessly

    <br>
    • Applied machine learning algorithms including logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and KNN, with Logistic
    Regression achieving the highest accuracy of 65.22%.
    <br>
    • Evaluated models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, highlighting Naive Bayes for highest recall and discussed
    trade-offs in model selection.</p>
